## Biography

I am a Master's student at Aalto University, Finland, majoring in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence (MACADAMIA). During my studies, I have completed multiple master's level machine learning courses such as Bayesian Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning: Supervised Methods, Reinforcement learning, Gaussian Processes, Machine Learning: Advanced Probabilistic Methods, and Modeling Biological Networks. Currently, I am thriving towards an academic career in Machine Learning.

On top of my studies, I like to be active in my free time, I have been keen on golfer for over a decade already. Recently, I have also started bouldering.
