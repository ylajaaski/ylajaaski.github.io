## Approach Accuracy of Professional Golfers on the PGA Tour

**Project description:**This project was done as a part of the course *CS-E5710 - Bayesian Data Analysis D*. This project involved choosing a data set and then performing a whole analysis according to all the parts of Bayesian workflow. We decided to study the approach accuracy of professional golfers on the PGA tour. The intuition suggests that the farther the player starts from the hole, the more difficult it is to get close to it.
